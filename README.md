# Methods Week in Statistics: Interpretable Machine Learning

This repository provides the materials for the methods week in Statistics on the topic "Interpretable Machine Learning".

The repository is structured as follows:
* **exercises**: exercise sheet (Exercise.pdf) for the practical part of the methods week & exercise sheet (exercises-wine) with (the same) questions transfered to the wine dataset (including solutions)
* **slides**: slides for the theoretical part of the methods week partitioned
